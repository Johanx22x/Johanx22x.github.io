                    <h3>Face Detection</h3>
                    <p>Face Detection is one of the most important fields in computer vision, itâ€™s the first step for further face analysis and data manipulation. Through this post I will explain how to detect a face into an image using Python and Mediapipe, a computer vision library for Python.</p>
