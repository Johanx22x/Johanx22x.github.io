                        <h3>My history</h3>
                        <p>
                        I was born in 2003 in Costa Rica, I have always been interested in technology and computers. My first 
                        contact with a computer was when I was 5 years old, my dad had a computer with Windows XP and I used to play
                        games and watch videos on it, I didn't understand much about it but I was fascinated by it. With the passing of 
                        time I started to spend more time on the computer, eventually I started to learn how to use it. Time passed and I 
                        entered high school, in my high school I had the opportunity to take a communication networks technician course, 
                        where I learned about computer networks, telecommunications and programming. I graduated from high school in 2021.
                        I don't know at what point I decided to study computer science, it only seemed natural to me since I have always been
                        interested in technology and computers. I started my studies at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology in 2022 and I'm
                        currently studying the Bachelor of Computer Engineering. In these years I have learned a lot about computer science, 
                        mathematics and problem solving.

                        <h3>My Interests</h3>
                        <p>
                        Since I started studying computer science I have been interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence,
                        I also started using <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> as my main operating system and I have learned a lot about it, due to this I started
                        being involved in the open source community and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/" target="_blank">Unix customizations</a>.

                        As a consequence of being interested in technology and computers, I discovered the world of japanese animation and 
                        manga, I have been watching anime and reading manga since 2019.

                        I consider myself a perfectionist, I like to do things well and I'm always looking for ways to improve, that's why I'm 
                        interested in design and user experience, when I have the opportunity to do something I always try to make it look good
                        and be easy to use.
