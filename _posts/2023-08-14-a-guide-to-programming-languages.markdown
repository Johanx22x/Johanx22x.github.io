</p>

In my own words and experience, programming languages are development tools that
allows a programmer to communicate with a processing unit, like a PC, while describing 
what a program has to do. There are many types of programming languages, most
of cases grouped by paradigm or level.

In this post I will share with you my knowledge about Programming Languages
and also some advices when learning a new language.

## Programming Paradigms

In programming world there are various paradigms, but esentially the most 
known paradigms are:

- Imperative
- Declarative
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional
- Procedural
- ...

Nowadays, most of the programming languages are multi-paradigm, that means that 
a language can handle more than one paradigm, for example, Python has characteristics
of imperative, OOP and functional programming. Most of times it is beneficial for the
programmer, because he/she can take advantage of different paradigms.

## Level of abstraction

In programming, the terms "high-level" and "low-level" refers to the level of
abstraction and the proximity to the hardware that a language or approach
offers. These terms describe the trade-off between ease of use, expressiveness,
and control over the underlying hardware.

### High Level

Languages that use High Level are more useful to understand and use by a 
programmer, because this abstraction level is nearest to a natural language 
as can be English or Spanish. Examples of this could be Python or Java.

### Low Level

On the other hand, Low Level means a closer approximation to the hardware, 
however, this is not as bad as it sounds, Low Level can mean a better 
hardware and memory use, drastically improving the performance of a 
program or application. C/C++ and Rust are commonly used languages that 
offers a Low Level approach.

## Languages I recommend to start with

Choose a programming language could be a tedious task, specially if you 
are a beginner. That's why I share a list of languages that I consider 
to be a good option to start with. Sorted by relevance.

- [Python](https://www.python.org): A beginner friendly and useful language for
all type of tasks.
- C/C++: I really recommend to lean C or C++ as soon as possible, that will give 
you a solid base for others languages. These two languages are a pillar in 
performance and the development of operating systems.
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/): This language will help you to learn 
the OOP concept, an important paradigm in software development.
- [Go](https://www.go.dev): One of my favorite languages, giving you 
the option to run parallel and synchronous task to improve programs 
performance. As useful as Python, giving more memory management and improving 
performance in some case.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org): Giving performance and low-level aspects,
Rust is, in my opinion, one of the most influential and interesting programming
languages of this decade.

## Some tips

There is a list of advices that can help you when trying to learn a new 
language:

- Practice: It sounds basic but it is the best way to learn something new.
- Read the official docs: Several programming languages have extensive
documentation in their official website, such as Go: [official Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/).
- Review code: It is important to follow a programming language conventions, 
ways to learn these conventions are read official documentation or review 
other programmers code. [GitHub](https://github.com) is a good engine to search
open source projects that implements a language you are interested in. That will
help you to know how a language is structured and more specifical details.

## My Favorite Resources

When I want to learn a new programming language I usually visit some 
of these websites:

- [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com): Best website to 
people who have experience in programming logic and want to learn a new 
language without starting from scratch.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com): This is a nice tool if you 
don't just copy and paste what it tells you. ChatGTP can give you 
extensive guides and tips about general and specific details as 
far as programming is concerned.
